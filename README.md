## Overview

Within the **Data Science for Bioinformatics** block, we are introducing the command line, which is a popular and important tool essential for bioinformatics. As part of a data-driven approach to answering research questions, the knowledge gained from this practical can be applied and transferred to different research domains.

Using the command line interface (also known as *bash*), we will demonstrate the basic structure of the UNIX operating system and how we can interact with it using a basic set of commands. Applying this, we will learn how to navigate the filesystem, manipulate text-based data e.g. DNA sequencing fastq files and structure a simple pipeline out of these commands.


## Setup

It is possible to work through the practical on your laptop or local machine. To do this, you will need to download the data that we will use in the practical and start/install the command line if not available in your device. Instructions for doing this are below.

### Data

The data is available to download [here](https://github.com/semacu/2021-intro-command-line/blob/main/data/shell_data.zip). Click the `Download` button and save the `shell_data.zip` file into your Desktop. Then navigate to your Desktop and double-click on the zip file to uncompress it. A directory call `shell_data/` should be available

### Command line

**MacOS**: to start the command line go to `Applications` -> `Utilities` -> `Terminal`. Alternatively, in your keyboard press the Command button and the space bar  simultaneously, type "Terminal" (as you type it should auto-fill) and double click "Terminal" in the left sidebar

**Windows**: computers with Windows do not automatically have a Unix command line program installed. To install the Unix command line in Windows, follow this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=339AEqk9c-8) and/or the instructions available in the Windows tab [here](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#shell)
