## Introduction to the Command Line

- Delivered on Monday 18th January 2021 3-5pm (GMT)
- Pre-recorded practical for self-paced study and helpdesk Q&A with video materials available in the [VLE](https://www.vle.cam.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=106822)

### Overview

Within the **Data Science for Bioinformatics** block, we are introducing the command line, which is a popular and important tool essential for bioinformatics. As part of a data-driven approach to answering research questions, the knowledge gained from this practical can be applied and transferred to different research domains.

Using the command line interface (also known as *bash*), we will demonstrate the basic structure of the UNIX operating system and how we can interact with it using a basic set of commands. Applying this, we will learn how to navigate the filesystem, manipulate text-based data e.g. DNA sequencing fastq files and structure a simple pipeline out of these commands.
